            I started cooking when I was 4 years old. Throughout my life, 
            I have been drawn to the kitchen, experimenting with flavors, techniques,
            and ingredients to create meals that are both satisfying and enjoyable. 
            Over the years, my skills have evolved beyond just following recipes—I now 
            have an intuitive sense of how to balance flavors, adjust seasonings,
            and modify dishes to suit different preferences. Whether it’s cooking for myself, preparing a meal for friends, or crafting something special for a date, I find joy in the process of turning simple ingredients into something delicious. With my love for food and a deep appreciation for high-quality ingredients, I’ve also learned to meal prep efficiently, balance my macros for fitness goals, and even tailor recipes to fit specific dietary needs. Cooking isn’t just a necessity
            for me—it’s an art, a form of self-expression, and a way to bring people together.

            Cooking is more than just making food—it’s an art, a science, and a way to bring people together. Recently, I’ve gotten into pasta making, and it’s completely changed the way I see food. There’s something incredibly satisfying about mixing flour and eggs by hand, kneading the dough to the perfect consistency, and rolling it out into silky sheets. Whether I’m crafting delicate ravioli, cutting fresh fettuccine, or shaping intricate tortellini, each step feels like a blend of tradition and creativity.

            Experimenting with different flours, fillings, and sauces has made me appreciate the simplicity and depth of Italian cuisine even more. The best part? Sharing homemade pasta with friends and family, seeing their reactions, and knowing that something made from scratch always tastes better.
